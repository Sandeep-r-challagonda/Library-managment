# Library-managment
This repo is the collection of python scripts for working with the SQL databases for managing library activities. The databases are manipulated with the mysql connector and CRUD operations are performed
based on the library activities such as Borrowing book, updating details. The files contain three classes namely Books, Librarian and Members along with the SQL database used, and test members credentials which can be helpful for knowing how the model works.
